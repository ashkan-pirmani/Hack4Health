# Mock Data Generator

In this repository, we created three different approaches to generate mock patient data.

## Mock-Generator-AP

An [IPythonNotebook](https://jupyter.org/) implementation using [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). Check the notebook to edit the generator configuration (refer to the third and seventh cell).

## Individual-HCH

An [IPythonNotebook](https://jupyter.org/) implementation using [names](https://pypi.org/project/names/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). Check the notebook to edit the generator configuration (refer to the fourth cell).

## Generator-MP

An implementation using only Python base packages. Configuration is done in the `config.json` file. Start it with `python Generator.py` and ensure `config.json` is in the same directory.
