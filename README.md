This repository is a collection of the code created during the Hack4Health hackathon by team FAIRy tale for the #HackTheSilos challenge. We envision a world where health data is available at the right time, at the right place in a common standard to the people that need it. All software should be available as open source software, in order to ensure the highest re-usability and transparency. At Hack4Health 2021, we made the first step towards this. This repository is our starting point, everyone is invited to contribute, re-use and hack our solutions.

Be open, flexible and FAIR. #dataSavesLives
